## Preliminary note
Namely: CryptoCorePack is monitored under the project-template **Automated Kanban with reviews** on GitHub, and managed under influence of **SCRUM**, therefore the project has **backlog** and, the project's development time-line is also guided by **Gitflow**, so it has some branches such as **_master_**, **_develop_**, **_release_**, **_feature/xyz_**, **_bugfix_**, **_hotfix_**. See more about the GitHub Kanban Panel of the [CryptoCorePack's project in its own page](https://github.com/users/ROPIMASI/projects/9), and see more about its [branches and time-line evolution in its own repository](https://github.com/ROPIMASI/CryptoCorePack). For a better reading know the table of [acronyms and abbreviations](https://github.com/ROPIMASI/CryptoCorePack/tree/master/documentation/acronyms-abbreviations.md).
