# To Do List
`documentation/to-do-list.md (v3)`  
This document is the official CryptoCorePack's to-do list. Lines are added by project's author only, based on the project's objectives and goals, and also based on contributor' suggestions, which were written in `suggestions-catcher.md`.  
  
Since this file's content `to-do-list.md` has already been analyzed so this file works as a table of tasks. Thus, no wonder, it seems like a SCRUM backlog. See more about [CryptoCorePack's backlogs](https://github.com/ROPIMASI/CryptoCorePack/tree/master/documentation/backlog-versions/).
