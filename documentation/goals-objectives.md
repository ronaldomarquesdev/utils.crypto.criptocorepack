# Goals and Objectives
`documentations/goals-objective.md (v3)`
This document is the official CryptoCorePack's goals and objectives list. This file's content is added by the author only, based on author's interests and needs of project itself. Maybe in the future the project's goals and objectives list can be filled by contributors, through the results of sequence of virtual events: round-table, debate, and convention, in that order.

## Author's main objectives
Main ROPIMASI's objective is to demonstrate some of its skills in _IT_ (Information Technology), more specifically in _CS_ (Computer Science). This demonstration is designated for representatives of companies that develop software or other solutions in digital technologies, for development team leaders, for the human resources department of those previously mentioned, or for those who are looking for a professional to integrate or lead their teams.  
Some skills used in this project are part of large areas of knowledge:
+ JAVA;
+ OOP;
+ Kanban;
+ Git;
+ GitHub;
+ GitFlow.  
<!-- + SCRUM in progress to be shown -->
<!-- + API further future -->
<!-- + Requirements Analysis soon future -->
<!-- + UML soon future -->
<!-- + MVC future -->

## Project's main objectives
The objective of this project is to implement a package of Java classes with symmetric and asymmetric cryptography features applicable to plain text values and  plain text files. The package should be implemented in such a way that it can be distributed and imported by projects that wish to use it. First CryptoCorePack must be able to respond by itself to the interactivity of the Command-Line-Interface, then to be importable to other desktop or server projects and, later, integrable with Web-Services projects.

## Project's main goals
#### CryptoCorePack's **first goal**
To release a MVP (minimum viable product) version, **0.1.0-_beta_**, which will have its main features as follow:
+ Testable by CLI (Command Line Interface) using commands and arguments;
  - Has an external micro application called 'encryp' to perform the encryptation test using this LIB CCP (CryptoCOrePack);
    - Able to get a natural text input from user on CLI and to perform it using CCP;
    - Able to process the following options as types of encrypt:
      - Symmetric Char Switching;
      - Symmetric Key Fusion;
      - Symmetric Token Injection.
  - Has an external micro application called 'decryp' to perform the decryptation test using this LIB CCP;
    - Able to get an encrypt text input from user on CLI and to perform it using CCP;
    - Able to process the following options as types of decrypt: 
      - Symmetric Char Switching;
      - Symmetric Key Fusion;
      - Symmetric Token Injection.
+ Provides internal information about the project itself;
  - Prints the value of 'DEBUG_MODE' flag variable on the console;
  - Prints the list of 'STANDARD INFOMATIONS CONSTANTS' on the console;
  - Prints the list of 'STANDARD ERROR MENSAGES CONSTANTS' along with their codes on the console;
  - Prints the list of 'PRE-DEFINED PROJECT PARAMS' on the console;
  - Prints the CLI's syntax of usage on the console;
  - Prints the explanation of usage on the console;
  - Prints a simple presentation of application's name and version on the console.  
  
#### CryptoCorePack's **second goal**
To release a MVP-stage (minimum viable product) version **0.2.0-_beta_** which will have its main features as follow:
+ All features listed in the previews version (0.1.0-beta);
+ Has exception handling;
+ Able to save the encrypt output to a text file named as defined by user on CLI, or 'encrypted.txt' as default.
+ Able to save the decrypt output to a text file named as defined by user on CLI, or 'decrypted.txt' as default.  
  
#### CryptoCorePack's **third goal**
Release the first full stable version **1.0.0-stable** which has its main features are as follow:
+ All features listed in the previews version (0.2.0-beta);
+ Under Requirements Analysis...
