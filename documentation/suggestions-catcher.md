# Suggestion Catcher
`documentation/suggestions-catcher.md (v4)`  
This document is the official CryptoCorePack's suggestions-catcher. Lines are added by volunteers and contributors, based on the project's objectives and goals, and also based on theirs experiences with this project.  
  
Since this file's content `suggestions-catcher.md`  had no been analyzed yet it works as a table of ideas. Thus, no wonder, it seems like a **_pre-_to-do-list.txt**.
