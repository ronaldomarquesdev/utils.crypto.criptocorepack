# PRESENTATION: `"0.1.0-backlog.txt" (v2)`
This document is the official CryptoCorePack's backlog documentation for the version **0.1.0-beta'**. This includes a features list as a target to be reached, then once the target is reached and merged to "release branch" the label "0.1.0-beta" is assigned to it. The backlog content is added by the project's author only, based on analysis of `goals-objectives.md` and `suggestions-catcher.md`. Maybe in the future the current version backlog document `M.n.p-backlog.md` can be filled by contributors, through the results of sequence of virtual events: round-table, debate, and convention, in that order.

##### A preliminary note
Namely: CryptoCorePack is monitored under the project-template "Automated Kanban with reviews" on GitHub, and managed under influence of "SCRUM", therefore the project has "backlog" and, the project's development time-line is also guided by "Gitflow", so it has some branches such as "master", "develop", "release", "feature/xyz", "bugfix", "hotfix". See more about the GitHub Kanban panel of the [CryptoCorePack's project in its own page](https://github.com/users/ROPIMASI/projects/9), and see more about its [branches and time-line evolution in its own repository](https://github.com/ROPIMASI/CryptoCorePack). For a better reading know the table of [acronyms and abbreviations](https://github.com/ROPIMASI/CryptoCorePack/tree/master/documentation/acronyms-abbreviations.txt).

  - Write newlines in the above part of the tables below staying up the most recent line (see and follow date column).  
+ All columns must be filled with its related data;
+ Any character must NOT be changed;
  - Keep unchanged presentation, warning, instructions, etc sections;
  - Keep unchanged table-title, column's top, column's bottom.  
+ CHANGE'S TYPE column must be only filled with the standard values:
  - New feature;
  - Documentation;
  - Improvement;
  - Bug fix.  
+ EACH COLUMN must obey/respect its length, as marked at column's top, e.g. 8, 16, 80, 112, 128, etc.:
  - At the top and bottom of column is possible to see that from first to last character of each column are represented by dash "-", and so on, but there are some pipe "|" characters spread being a especial character as columns limiter;

+Every line added on table below **must** have its **destination**, meaning that each issue is created **already** containing its **d**estination **r**elease **id**entification (in abbreviated form **RDID**). Examples of RDIDs: "**RD-1.0.0**" , "**RD-2.1.4**". **NOTE:** during CryptoCorePack's development progress is possible occurs needs to change the **RDID** of some specifics issues.
